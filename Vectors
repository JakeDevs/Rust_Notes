Vectors are like arrays except they use dynamic memory allocation (heap).


Ex:

let vector = vec![1,2,3,4,5]
____________________________

To print the value of a vector do the following:

println!("{:?}",vector;

Mutability still applies to vectors, so if you want it to change throughout
the program add the keyword mut.
