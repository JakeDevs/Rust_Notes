Although an integer is a datatype in rust, all integers fall under sub types.
__________________
Signed|  Unsigned |
i8    |    u8     |
i16   |   u16     |
i32   |   u32     |
i64   |   u64     |
i128  |   u128    |
isize |   usize   |

If you do not specify the subtype, it will by default use i32.

OPTIMIZATION

If you are using a small value for a variable, it is important
to downsize the bit depth to something like u8 or i8. This will optimize your
program. Every bit counts!

Ex:

	let variable_name:u8 = 1;
