Sometimes we need a loop to run but only if a condition is true. This is where the while loop comes in. When the condition is no longer true, the loop breaks. 
You can do this with a normal loop with loop, if, else, and break but this isn'toptimal and the while loop is much cleaner in the sense that it is shorter.

Ex: 

fn main() {
    let tup = [1,2,3,4,5];

    let mut index =0;

    while index <5 {
        println!("{}",tup[index]);

        index = index + 1;
    }
}

There is also the for loop. The for loop is considered by many Rustaceans the
most useful loop in rust. 

Ex:
 for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{}", number)
_____________________________
For every number the range of 1 to 4, the program will iterate the value for 
every element in the collection.
