Sequences, or sequencial way of thinking is basically how computers read. From
top to bottom to left to right. This is the most basic form of programming.

Conditions help us make decisions in a non linear way. 
If the coniditon is true we do one thing otherwise we do something else.

Loops will use conditions to decide how many times a code block will be repeated.
Put simply, the code block will be repeated as long as the condition is true.
For example, if you made a game where you have to guess a randomly generated number,
The loop will keep repeating on the condition that you have guessed incorrectly.
Once you have guessed correctly, the condition is now true so the loop will end.

These three different flow controls come together to create a computer program.
If you take any computer program, you can break it down into Sequences, Conditions,
and Loops. This is Control Flow.
