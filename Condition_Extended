In Rust, it is possible to use conditional expressions to initialize variables. 
Ex:

fn main() {
    let flag = false;
    let number = if flag {10} else {2};

    println!("The value of number is {}", number);
}
___________________________________________________

This code is saying that if flag is true, then print the value 10.
If flag is not true, then print the value 2.

Keep in mind that if you do not use the else condition then the compiler
won't compile the code.
