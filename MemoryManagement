In many, programming languages, you don't have to deal with memory management.
This has many benefits but also some steep drawbacks. Rust gives you control
while being very memory safe.

Stack
_____
When learning stack we must think of a stack of paper. The main function
is first in the stack, and function 1 and 2 follow it. The top of the stack
gets executed first (function 2) and the beginning of the stack last (main).
It is a simple last in first out rule. Once the code in that function
is done executing the piece of paper is destroyed until it is done with
every function. Then the stack is empty. Realistically, without
the paper analogy, each function will have a block of memory to it. 
All the function calls inside the main function will be stacked like a stack of paper. Last in first out, just like a stack of paper. Now, there's
a small problem with stack. Stack is determined on compile, so it already knows
everything when the program compiles. However, what if you had an empty string
that you wanted the user to input? You wouldn't know how big it would be on
compile so there's the heap for that. The heap and stack are fundamentally
different. One more thing, the pointer is storing a memory address to a location
in the memory then it's called a pointer.


Scope
_____
Scope is the part of the code that a variable is going to be accessible. 
For example:

fn main() {
let a = String::new();
}

The variable a is only available in the main function, so that is the scope
of the a variable.

Heap
____
A pointer is a variable that points to a memory location. In programmng there is
dynamic storage. We have a place for this called the heap. The heap is basicallylimitless because it needs to be dynamic if the value of the string changes
throughout the program.

Ownership
_________
There are 3 rules to ownership.

1. Each value in Rust has a variable and that's called its onwer.
2. There can only be one owner at a time.
3. When the value goes out of scope, the owner will be dropped.

Lets play around with different ways of initializing variables to further
understand ownership.
Ex:

fn main() {
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = num1;
println("num1 = {} and num2 = {}",num1,num2);
}

Lets break down what's really happening here.
The value of num1 is being copied in to a seperate memory space for num2.
They are completely seperate, so we are not breaking ownership rules.
