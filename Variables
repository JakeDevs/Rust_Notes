Variables are, explained simply, boxes that can store values. 
The benefit of using a variable is that the value of that variable can change
throughout the program.

To create a variable, the proper syntax is:

fn main() {
    let variable_name = 1;	
}

This creates a variable.

-Variable names cannot start with numbers and cannot contain spaces.
A good solution if you need spacing is underscore or camelcase.

Camelcase: variableName

Underscore: variable_name

These are two great ways to seperate words in Rust.

In Rust you can also add two variables together or subtract or divide or multiply.

Ex:

	let num1 = 5;
	let num2= 10;
	let sum = num1 + num2;

____________________________________________


Variables by default are not mutable but can become mutable if you add mut 
to the syntax.

Ex: let mut x = 10;

On the opposite end of the spectrum, there is constants. Constants, unlike variables,
do not change throughout the program.

Ex: const pi:f32 = 3.14;
