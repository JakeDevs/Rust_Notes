To understand enums think of going into a store and getting a drink.
There is small medium and large. Enums are how we would translate this.

enum Drink {
	Small,
	Medium,
	Large
	}

________________
Now, the enum is by default given values 0,1,2 for small med large and so on.
However, if we tried to print this we would get an error
