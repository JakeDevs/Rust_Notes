To understand enums think of going into a store and getting a drink.
There is small medium and large. Enums are how we would translate this.

enum Drink {
	Small,
	Medium,
	Large
	}

________________
Now, the enum is by default given values 0,1,2 for small med large and so on.
However, if we tried to print this we would get an error. This is where the as
keyword comes in, commonly used to turn primitive times into other primitive
types.

Ex:

println!("{}",burger_size as u32);

Enums also have other very important uses such as error handling.
