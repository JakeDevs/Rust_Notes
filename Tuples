Tuples are like arrays but with one key advantage: they can contain multiple
data types.

Ex:


 let s = (1,2.5,"hello"); 

Notice how we have an integer, float, and string.
3 different data types.

To access elements in a tuple you can:

println!("{}",t.3);

here were are pointed to the 3rd element in the tuple so it will print hello.
You can also specify data types for a tuple.

Ex:

let t1:(i8,f32) = (1,2.5);
