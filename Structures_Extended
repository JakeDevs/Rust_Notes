Functions can be created inside structures.
Functions inside structures are called methods.

Ex: struct Rectangle {
	width: u32,
	height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
	fn area(&self) -> u32 {
	self.width * self.height
	}

}

______________________
The most important thing to remember is the self parameter.
It is a reference to the actual structure.
Okay, so now we know how to add functions to a structure, lets talk about how
we can actually use them.

As you can see in the code above, the width and the height variables do not have values assigned to them. So now we can do that in the main function.
fn main() {
let rect1 = Rectangle {
	width:20,
	height:30
	}

	println!("{}", rect1.area());
	This displays the area of the rectangle.

}
